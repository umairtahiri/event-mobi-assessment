This is TAKE - HOME - ASSESSMENT by EventMobi

The App fetches the gists list based on username and can see the gist details by clicking on the table row.

I have tried to complete the assessment in best of manner and coding practices, but due to limited time you might observe that there is lot of improvement I feel myself.

What could have been improved:

1. Better styling of table and detail card.
2. Pagination in the gists table, since I have not able to find the count info in the gist API, So I set count to 1000.
3. Better and more test cases.
4. I wanted to write the test cases for each hepler function also.
5. Also I have not added the badges, due to time limit.
6. Better error handling could have been done.
7. Back button on the detail page.
8. Better type handling
